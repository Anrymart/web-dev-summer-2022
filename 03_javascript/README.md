## Problems

1. Factorize a number
1. Write a function that calculates n-th Fibonacci number
1. Write a function that calculates the average of the numbers in an array of
   numbers. What if we pass arguments separated by comma?
1. Reverse a string
1. Merge two arrays and return the result in a new array
1. Create a function that accepts an array of numbers as argument and returns a
   new array with distinct elements
1. Write a function sum(x)(y) = x + y
1. Write a function printNumbers(from, to) that outputs a number every second,
   starting from and ending with to. More complex version: print Fibonacci
   series in the same manner.


## Home Task

Implement a JavaScript library for 2D-vectors. User should be able to create vector, add, subtract, multiply (scalar product), find length, find unit vectors, find direction angle. Operations should not modify current vector.

Here is an example of how the library may be used:

```javascript
// Constructing a vector
const a = new Vector(1, 2);
// Another possible way to construct a vector
const b = Vector.of(2, 0.5);

const sum = a.add(b);
const abs = sum.abs();
```
